# Body/Content
**Target Scale Initial Asset Weight (Target Scale IAW)** is a computed parameter used in risk management frameworks, like those in Drift Protocol, to dynamically scale collateral or margin requirements based on predefined safety criteria. It determines the optimal “scale” or multiplier of deposits notional that can be safely allocated to an asset or position, reflecting the asset’s ability to maintain stability and pass specific risk checks.

In simpler terms, **Target Scale IAW** represents the adjusted collateral scaling factor, ensuring that positions are adequately backed without exposing the protocol or users to unnecessary risk.

## **Role of Target Scale IAW**

1. **Dynamic Risk Management**:
	 - Unlike a fixed IAW, **Target Scale IAW** adjusts based on an asset’s performance against safety criteria.
	 - This ensures that the protocol’s requirements are responsive to changing risk conditions.
2. **Enhanced Collateral Efficiency**:
	 - Traders can maximize their leverage or position sizes when assets are deemed safer (i.e., when all safety criteria pass).
3. **Preventative Safeguard**:
	 - Restricts scaling for assets or positions that fail one or more safety checks, mitigating systemic risks in volatile or illiquid markets.
4. **Transparent Decision-Making**:
	 - The **Target Scale IAW** is computed from explicit rules, making it easier for users to understand why they can or cannot maximize their position sizes.

---
## **Formula**

The **Target Scale IAW** is a conditional value:

Target Scale IAW =
((1.2 x Total Deposits Notional) {if all safety criteria pass}) || ((N/A) or {fallback value})`

Where:
 - **Total Deposits Notional**: The total collateral value deposited by the user.
 - **Safety Criteria**: Defined rules for determining an asset’s stability and risk profile (e.g., liquidity, leverage checks).

---
## **Safety Criteria for Target Scale IAW**
In Drift Protocol’s example, four specific criteria determine whether **Target Scale IAW** is set:
1. **On-Chain Liquidity Check**:
	 - Evaluates whether a simulated swap incurs acceptable price impact (low slippage).
2. **Effective Leverage (Spot Positions)**:
	 - Ensures that spot positions do not exceed safe leverage thresholds.
3. **Effective Leverage (Perp Positions)**:
	 - Ensures that perpetual futures positions are within a specified leverage range.
4. **Excess Leverage Coverage (Perp Market Insurance)**:
	 - Verifies that users with excessive leverage are sufficiently covered by the insurance fund.

If all these criteria pass, the **Target Scale IAW** is maximized; otherwise, it defaults to a fallback value (e.g., N/A or zero).

---
## **Practical Use of Target Scale IAW**
**Scenario 1: All Criteria Pass**
 - A trader deposits $50,000.
 - All safety checks pass.
 - Target Scale IAW is calculated as:
	 - 1.2 x 50,000 = 60,000
	 - This allows the trader to scale their positions up to a notional value of $60,000.

**Scenario 2: Some Criteria Fail**
 - A trader deposits $50,000.
 - One or more criteria fail (e.g., [[20241223-170104 Excess Leverage Coverage|Excess Leverage Coverage]] is insufficient).
 - Target Scale IAW is set to **N/A** or another fallback value.

---
## **Key Benefits of Target Scale IAW**

1. **Encourages Safer Trading**:
	 - Traders are incentivized to maintain positions and strategies that pass safety checks, reducing systemic risks.
2. **Dynamic Scaling**:
	 - Adjusts in real-time based on asset performance and market conditions, allowing flexibility without compromising stability.
3. **Protocol Stability**:
	 - Protects the platform by limiting exposure to risky positions, ensuring adequate collateralization.
4. **Transparency**:
	 - Each component of the calculation is explicitly tied to measurable criteria, fostering trust and understanding among users.

---
## **Engineering Considerations**

1. **Real-Time Updates**:
	 - The **Target Scale IAW** must recalculate dynamically as market conditions, positions, or collateral levels change.
2. **Fallback Handling**:
	 - Define a clear fallback behavior when criteria fail:
		 - Use “N/A” or “0” to indicate an invalid Target Scale IAW.
		 - Log the reasons for failure for transparency.
1. **Error Handling**:
	 - Account for missing or delayed data (e.g., from oracles or external APIs) to avoid disruptions in Target Scale IAW calculations.
2. **Visualization**:
	 - Display the Target Scale IAW and its breakdown (criteria results, calculations) prominently in the Risk Dashboard.
	 - Provide tooltips or hover-over details explaining the formula and results.
3. **Testing**:
	 - Validate against edge cases:
		 - All criteria pass.
		 - Partial failure.
		 - Missing or malformed data inputs.

## **Example Implementation**

### **Target Scale IAW Calculation**
```python
def calculate_target_scale_iaw(deposits_notional: float, criteria_results: dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Target Scale IAW based on total deposits notional and criteria results.

    Args:
        deposits_notional (float): Total collateral deposited.
        criteria_results (dict): Pass/Fail results for each safety criterion.

    Returns:
        float: Target Scale IAW, or 0 if criteria fail.
    """
    if all(criteria_results.values()):  # All criteria pass
        return 1.2 * deposits_notional
    else:
        return 0  # Fallback value if any criteria fail

# Example usage
deposits_notional = 50000  # USD
criteria_results = {
    "on_chain_liquidity": True,
    "spot_leverage": True,
    "perp_leverage": True,
    "excess_coverage": False,  # This fails
}

target_scale_iaw = calculate_target_scale_iaw(deposits_notional, criteria_results)
print(f"Target Scale IAW: {target_scale_iaw if target_scale_iaw > 0 else 'N/A'}")
# Output: Target Scale IAW: N/A
```

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Target Scale IAW** is a dynamic parameter that adjusts based on safety criteria, promoting responsible trading and platform stability.

2. It allows traders to safely scale their positions while ensuring adequate collateralization.

3. A robust implementation requires transparent criteria evaluation, real-time recalculations, and fallback mechanisms for failure cases.
